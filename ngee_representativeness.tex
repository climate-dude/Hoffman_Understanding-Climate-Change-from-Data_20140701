  \item NGEE Arctic process studies and observations are strongly linked to model development and application for improving process representation, initialization, calibration, and evaluation.
  \item A hierarchy of models will be deployed at fine, intermediate, and climate scales to connect observations to models and models to each other in a quantitative up-scaling and down-scaling framework.

%% \begin{itemize}
%%  \item Need for studies of the complex and interacting processes of the
%%atmosphere, sea ice, ocean, and terrestrial systems in Arctic to improve
%%the interpretation of past climate and projections of future climate.
%%  \item Committee on Designing an Arctic Observing Network  recommended an
%%Arctic Observing Network to satisfy current and future scientific by
%%monitoring key physical, biogeochemical, and human dimensions
%%variables.
%%  \item Conducting systematic and continuous field observations and long
%%term monitoring are challenging, particularly in the Arctic.

 \frametitle{Quantitative Sampling Network Design}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Resource and logistical constraints limit the frequency and extent
  of observations, necessitating the development of a systematic sampling
  strategy that objectively represents environmental variability at the
  desired spatial scale.
  \item Required is a methodology that provides a quantitative framework
  for informing site selection and determining the representativeness
  of measurements.
  \item Multivariate spatiotemporal clustering (MSTC) was applied at
  the landscape scale (4~km$^2$) for the State of Alaska to demonstrate
  its utility for representativeness and scaling.
  \item An extension of the method applied by Hargrove and Hoffman for
  design of National Science Foundation's (NSF's) National Ecological
  Observatory Network (NEON) domains \citep{Schimel_FrontEcolEnviron_20070301,Keller_FrontEcolEnviron_20080601}.

 \frametitle{NGEE Arctic Site Representativeness}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item This representativeness analysis uses the standardized
$n$-dimensional data space formed from all input data layers.
  \item In this data space, the Euclidean distance between a sampling
location (like Barrow) and every other point is calculated.
  \item These data space distances are then used to generate
grayscale maps showing the similarity, or lack thereof, of every
location to the sampling location.
  \item In the subsequent maps, white areas are well represented by
the sampling location or network, while dark and black areas
as poorly represented by the sampling location or network.
  \item This analysis assumes that the climate surrogates maintain
their predictive power and that no significant biological
adaptation occurs in the future.

 \begin{itemize}
  \item MSTC provides a quantitative framework for stratifying sampling domains, informing site selection, and determining representativeness of measurements.
  \item Representativeness analysis provides a systematic approach for up-scaling point measurements to larger domains.
  \item Methodology is independent of resolution, thus can be applied from site/plot scale to landscape/climate scale.
  \item It can be extended to include finer spatiotemporal scales, more geophysical characteristics, and remote sensing data.
  \item Methodology described in Open Access paper: \\
