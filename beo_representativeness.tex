Representativeness map for vegetation sampling points for A, B, C, and D
sampling area (left) and zoomed in on the C samping area (right) developed
from WorldView2 satellite images for the year 2010 and LiDAR data.

Vegetation sampling locations represent polygon troughs (red), edges
(green), and centers (blue).
